== Congo Templates

The Congo Template Engine aims to be a template engine in principle
quite similar to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeMarker[FreeMarker]
written by the main FreeMarker developer.

Congo templates aim to be a replacement for FreeMarker in the
ongoing development of https://parsers.org/[CongoCC]
